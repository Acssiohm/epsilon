/* According to arm documentation, available at :
 * https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ihi0042/latest/
 *  Typically, the registers r4-r8, r10 and r11 (v1-v5, v7 and v8) are used to
 *  hold the values of a routineâ€™s local variables. Of these, only v1-v4 can be
 *  used uniformly by the whole Thumb instruction set, but the AAPCS does not
 *  require that Thumb code only use those registers.
 *  A subroutine must preserve the contents of the registers r4-r8, r10, r11
 *  and SP (and r9 in PCS variants that designate r9 as v6).
 * r10 and r8 seem less likely to be used if a register is required between
 * storage and loading of an argument (which should be avoided anyway).
 * In fact, all registers might be used at any point. To solve this issue,
 * registers content are stored on the stack before calling svcall, and put back
 * after.
 * TODO HUGO : Look for alternative for this fix.
